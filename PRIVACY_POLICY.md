## Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. This section outlines how we handle user data when you use our Discord bot:

- **Data Collection**: Our bot may collect and store certain data necessary for its functionality, such as user IDs, messages, and commands entered.

- **Data Usage**: The collected data is used solely for the purpose of providing the bot's intended functionality. We do not share this data with third parties.

- **Data Protection**: We implement reasonable security measures to protect the collected data from unauthorized access or disclosure.

- **Data Retention**: We retain user data only for as long as it is necessary for the bot's functionality. Once the data is no longer needed, it will be deleted.

> We have the following data removal processes:
>
> - A user can run the `/remove permanently=True` command which will delete all their data from the database.
> - Immediately after a user leaves a server (or the server gets deleted), their server specific preferences data stored is erased.
> - Immediately after a user leaves all servers (or the server gets deleted) that the CodeGrind Bot is/was also in, all the data stored on the user is deleted.

- **Anonymous Usage Data**: We may collect anonymous usage data to improve the bot's performance and features. This data does not contain personal information.

Please note that while we take precautions to protect user data, no method of data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. By using our bot, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with data transmission over the internet.

If you have any questions or concerns about our data handling practices, please reach us in our dedicated CodeGrind Bot server: [CodeGrind Arena](https://discord.com/invite/T4xRgssgu9).
