# About CodeGrind Bot
CodeGrind Bot helps you master LeetCode by competing with your friends on daily, weekly and all-time server leaderboards. Simply connect your LeetCode account to this bot and you are ready to go!

This bot also provides you commands to get a random LeetCode question, the LeetCode daily question, retrieve the Zerotrac rating of a question, and receive a notification of the LeetCode daily question and the daily/weekly winners leaderboards.

## Score calculation
Each connected user is assigned a score which calculated based on the amount of questions you have solved. 
Here is how much each question difficulty is worth:
>    - Easy questions are worth {DIFFICULTY_SCORE['easy']} point
>    - Medium questions are worth {DIFFICULTY_SCORE['medium']} points
>    - Hard questions are worth {DIFFICULTY_SCORE['hard']} points
