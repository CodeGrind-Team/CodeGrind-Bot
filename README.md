## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

CodeGrind Bot is a Discord bot designed for competitive coding enthusiasts. Using the LeetCode API, it allows users to track and compare their coding stats for daily, weekly, and all-time periods, promoting friendly competition and continuous skill progression.

Created with discord.py, CodeGrind Bot transforms your programming journey into an inclusive, interactive, and engaging experience. It's an open-source project, making contributions from anyone in the community more than welcome - your input can help it grow, improving its capabilities and user-friendliness.

Please note: while the bot uses the LeetCode API for data, it's not officially affiliated with LeetCode. Proper respect for the copyrights and terms of use of LeetCode is expected from all users.

Join us on this coding showdown. Invite CodeGrind bot to your server today, and let the coding quest begin!

## Built With

CodeGrind Bot makes use of several robust and powerful libraries. Key dependencies include:

1. [**Python 3.11.4**](https://www.python.org/): The language in which CodeGrind Bot is primarily written, renowned for its simplicity and versatility.

2. [**topggpy**](https://docs.top.gg/): The official Python library that allows CodeGrind Bot to interact effectively with the top.gg API.

3. [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): An open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database known for handling high volume data storage.

4. [**Motor**](https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The Python asynchronous driver used for MongoDB, playing a significant role in assuring efficient data operations.

5. [**discord.py**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A modern, Pythonic library utilized for interactive handling of the Discord API.

6. [**BeautifulSoup4 & bs4**](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/): Libraries used for effective data extraction from HTML and XML files, enhancing web scraping functionalities.

7. [**python-dotenv**](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): Manages environment variables effectively from ".env" files.

Each of these components is crucial in ensuring the smooth operation, efficiency, and utility of CodeGrind Bot.

## Getting Started

To set up a testing version of the bot, you need to follow the steps ahead:

### Initial Setup

1. **Create a Discord application:** Visit [Discord developers applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application.

2. **Add bot:** Substitute `<YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID>` with your application's client id in the link below and press the link to add it to your selected server.

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID>&scope=bot&permissions=8
```

### Database and Browser Configuration

3. **Create a MongoDB database:** Go to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), create a database, get the MongoDB URI (connection string), and add your IP address to the IP access list in the network access tab.

4. **Install Chrome:** Chrome needs to be installed on your local machine. Identify the path to your chrome executable. For example, on Windows, it might be `C:/Users/UserName/AppDataLocal/Google/Chrome/chrome.exe`, whereas on Linux, it might be `/usr/bin/chromium-browser`. Remember to convert all backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`). This path will be used for executing the `/stats` command.

5. **Create a .env file:** Within the project's root directory, create a `.env` file and add the environment variables given below. Replace `<your_discord_bot_token>`, `<your_mongodb_uri>`, and `<path_to_chrome_executable>` with your specific values.

   ```
   TOKEN=<your_discord_bot_token>
   MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
   BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=<path_to_chrome_executable>
   PRODUCTION=False
   UPDATE_STATS_ON_START=False
   DAILY_RESET_ON_START=False
   WEEKLY_RESET_ON_START=False
   ```

### Virtual Environment Setup

6. **Python version:** Ensure Python version `3.11` or higher is installed on your computer.

7. **Setup a virtual environment:** Install the Python `venv` module and set up a virtual environment. [Here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) are the instructions for setting up a Python's virtual environment.

   To activate the virtual environment, navigate to the directory where the virtual environment is located and run the following commands:

   - For Windows:

     ```
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For Unix or macOS:

     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

8. **Install required libraries:** With the virtual environment activated, install all the necessary libraries using the following pip command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Bot

9. **Run the bot:** With all the setup complete, run the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   You should now be able to execute bot commands on your server.

### (Optional) Run Database Utils

If you wish to run the database utils inside `/tests/database_utils`, follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal inside the root folder and run the following command:

   ```
   python tests/database_utils/<name_of_file>.py
   ```

2. Provide the required data asked in the terminal.

3. The util should now run successfully.
