## About the Project

CodeGrind Bot is a Discord bot designed for LeetCode enthusiasts. Using the LeetCode API, it allows users to track and compare your coding stats for daily, weekly, and all-time periods, promoting friendly competition and continuous skill progression.

Created with discord.py, CodeGrind Bot transforms your programming journey into an inclusive, interactive, and engaging experience. It's an open-source project, making contributions from anyone in the community more than welcome - your input can help it grow, improving its capabilities and user-friendliness.

Please note: while the bot uses the LeetCode API for data, it's not officially affiliated with LeetCode. Proper respect for the copyrights and terms of use of LeetCode is expected from all users.

Join us on this coding showdown. Invite CodeGrind bot to your server today, and let the coding quest begin!

## Built with

CodeGrind Bot makes use of several libraries. Key dependencies include:

1. [**discord.py**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A modern, Pythonic library utilized for interactive handling of the Discord API.

2. [**topggpy**](https://docs.top.gg/): The official Python library that allows CodeGrind Bot to interact effectively with the top.gg API.

3. [**Beanie ODM**](https://beanie-odm.dev/): An asynchronous Python object-document mapper (ODM) for MongoDB. Data models are based on Pydantic.

4. [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): An open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database known for handling high volume data storage.

Each of these components is crucial in ensuring the smooth operation, efficiency, and utility of CodeGrind Bot.
