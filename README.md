## About the Project

CodeGrind Bot is a Discord bot designed for LeetCode users that promotes friendly competition and continuous skill progression. Users can track and compare their LeetCode stats in daily/weekly/monthly/all-time leaderboards within their server or globally, among many other LeetCode related commands.

> Please note: while the bot uses the LeetCode API for data, it's not officially affiliated with LeetCode. Proper respect for the copyrights and terms of use of LeetCode is expected from all users.
